# A\* Algorithm implementation
## Project for the course "Artificial Intelligence" at NTUA
<b>Part one:</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of a NxN grid/map randomly, guaranteeing at least one path which leads from the starting point to the end point. <br>
<b>Part two:</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implementation of A\* Algorithm, written in Python, and using it on the grid of *part one*.<br>
<b>Part three:</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparing A\* with different heuristics and **BFS** and **Dijkstra** algorithms, over path length, expanded nodes, grid size and probability (metric on how dense the grid is).
